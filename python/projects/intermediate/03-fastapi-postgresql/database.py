Base=declarative_base()
# It creates a base class for all your database models.
# Every model class (like Question, Choices) must inherit from this to be recognized by SQLAlchemy as a database table.

# ðŸ”¸ sessionmaker (from SQLAlchemy)
# Itâ€™s a factory for creating new Session objects.
# Think of it as a template or configuration for your sessions.

# ðŸ”¸ autocommit=False
# You want explicit control over when data is saved to the database.
# If autocommit=True, the session will automatically commit every change, which is dangerous in many use cases.
# With False, you write db.commit() yourself when you're ready to persist changes.

# ðŸ”¸ autoflush=False
# Normally, SQLAlchemy will flush changes (send them to the database) before every query, to keep the session in sync.
# Setting this to False gives you manual control, improving performance in some situations.
# You can still manually flush using db.flush().

# ðŸ’¡ Even with autoflush=False, db.commit() will still flush pending changes.

# ðŸ”¸ bind=engine
# This tells the session to use the engine (your actual connection to the PostgreSQL database) created earlier with:
# engine = create_engine(URL_DATABASE)
